## Unit and Integration Testing

* Unit: Testing a specific function / component / feature.
* Integration: Testing features / components in combination.

* Can auto-detect test-related files
* Jest was originally developed with React in-mind
* Automated testing
* Fast and efficient
* CLI tool

## End-to-End Testing

* End-to-End: testing a project from a user perspective - think user stories.

Cypress! What is it?

* JavaScript web testing and component testing framework
* Integration and end-to-end testing
* GUI tool
* Opens a web browser and navigates the project as if it were a user

Cypress Pros:

* Enhance confidence in the product
* Detects if there are issues in the user flow
* Can potentially catch oddities w/global CSS
* Capable of taking screenshots and video recordings
* Completely stack agnostic, as long as your browser can see it you can test it!
* Cypress does have very detailed and mature documentation

Cypress Cons:

* Takes more time than Jest!
