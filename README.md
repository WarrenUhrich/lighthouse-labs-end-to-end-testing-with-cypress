# Lighthouse Labs | End-to-End Testing with Cypress

* [X] What is Cypress?
* [X] Getting Started with Cypress

## Testing Terms!

* Unit Testing: Testing individual pieces/"units" of our code! This usually means functions or components.
* Integration Testing: Testing multiple units together!
* Manual Testing: Running our app (maybe adding some `console.log`) to see what works!
* Automated Testing: Running pre-written tests/assertions using a test-runner (like Mocha or Jest!)
* End-to-End Testing: "Big picture!" How does our app as a whole run from a user-like perspective?

What was Jest?

* Automated testing / test runner!
* Ships with React!
* "Testing framework!"
* Intended for React and plays very nicely with it!
* CLI tool
* Very fast!
* Integrated testing!
* Unit testing!

## What is Cypress?

* Tool for end-to-end testing
* Able to run a browser and incorporate this in its testing
    * Allows us to script browser events to trigger things like typing into a field, clicking a link, pressing a button, etc.
* Opens doors to responsive testing
* Increase confidence in app behaviours
* Can be used to test more than just basic code on/off, can see if the elements are visible in-page
* It is capable of recording test sessions as videos
* It is capable of taking screenshots of test case results
* ***Completely*** agnostic to the stack/language you use to develop your application
* Is very premium (GUI, extensive documentation) for a developer tool
