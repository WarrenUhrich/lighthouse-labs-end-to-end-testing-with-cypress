# Lighthouse Labs | End-to-End Testing with Cypress

* [X] What is Cypress?
* [ ] Getting Started with Cypress

## Jest

* Automated testing framework for unit and integration testing
* CLI tool
* Very fast and efficient
* Shines when dealing with functions, components

## Cypress

* Offers a GUI
* Capable of running through an app / features as if it were a user
* Much slower than something like Jest (must run through the tests like a person would)
* Completely agnostic to the stack in-use (capable of testing even without the source)
* Free
* Very very well documented!
