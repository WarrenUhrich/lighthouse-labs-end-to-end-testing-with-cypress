# Lighthouse Labs | End-to-End Testing with Cypress

* [X] What is Cypress?
* [ ] Getting Started with Cypress

## Jest

* CLI approach to automated testing
* Intended for unit-testing and integration testing
* Very, very fast and efficient
* Shines when used for testing functions, components, specific focus!

## Cypress

* Wholistic approach to testing (end-to-end)
* Can be used to test core application features (many components working together)
* Agnostic to the stack used - access to the back-end is unnecessary to write tests
* Free! (There are paid options, but we're fortunate to have a full-featured free application of this calibre!)

## Why Use Cypress?

* Flexible - we can test apps with, or without, access to source code.
* It is capable of taking screenshots and videos of tests.
* One of the most well documented free softwares out there!
