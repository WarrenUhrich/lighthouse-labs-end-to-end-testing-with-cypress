# Lighthouse Labs | End-to-End Testing with Cypress

* [ ] What is Cypress?
* [ ] Getting Started with Cypress

## Unit and Integration Testing

* Unit: testing surrounding a "unit" - often a function or Component runnning in isolation.
* Integration: testing how units work *together*

### Jest

* Testing framework (intended largely for React)
* CLI tool
* Automated testing

#### Pros

* Very very fast / efficient
* Once tests are written, saves a lot of time
* Built specifically for React components!
* Excels at unit / integration testing

## End-to-End

End-to-End: "simulates" user behaviour to evaluate if user stories are present and working.

### Cypress

* GUI Application
* Cypress deploys a web browser (electron/chromium) in order to simulate a user walking through your website's features
* JavaScript web testing and component testing framework
* ---> integration and end-to-end testing

#### Pros of Cypress?

* Easy-to-use GUI makes for a simpler development experience
* Getting a good view of the user experience during testing
    * Capable of screenshots
    * Capable of video recording
* Widely used tool, very mature/premium, and there is support
* Opens the door to responsive responsive testing
* Opens the door to checking if certain CSS, HTML, etc. is present in the page
* Able to test any page we can request in a browser
    * We don't necessarily need access to the source code!
* ---> The above makes it useful for testing any stack web app
